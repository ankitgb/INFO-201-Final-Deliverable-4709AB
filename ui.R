If you select 'total_vaccinations' from the drop down menu for the y-axis, select start date as '01/01/2021', and end date as '02/02/2021', the code will create plot 1 which shows the total number of vaccinations that occurred over the month of January 2021. Some patterns that I have noticed within the data are that Washington State (colored in Pink) has a significantly higher vaccination rate than the other states in America. As the year began, people started with a low daily amount of vaccinations but this quickly increased from 0 vaccinations at the start of the month all the way to 3*10^7 vaccinations by the start of February. Out of all the states, the southern-most states seem to have the least amount of total vaccinations by the end of January followed by the midwest states. One general trend that we have observed after creating these interactive plots with the data is that people are generally increasing their rates of vaccination as time goes on, yet some states are falling behind others in the race to get fully vaccinated. As you dive deeper into our project exploring the interactive pages regarding COVID-19 vaccination trends in the United States, many new variables will arise such as total distribution.

From looking at our previous questions and variables that we looked at, we decided to put the two together to analyze the specifics about the relationship. As you can see in the graph created after inputting these two variables, the relationship is quite positive, where as the number of distributed vaccines increases, the number of people getting vaccinated also increases tremendously. There are several things that could have affected these results such as people resistant to vaccinations and inaccurate inventories of doses of vaccines distributed and shipped out. These factors were taken into account when creating this application and take impact in our results and findings.

As time goes on, the results can be viewed in a positive way as more and more people are being informed about the benefits to COVID-19 vaccination and being influenced to go get vaccinated. Washington State and the West Coast States seem to be the areas with the most total vaccinations, yet the other states are well on their way to increasing their vaccination rates as well.
                  A key takeaway in the Vaccination across the States chart is that
                 A key takeaway in the relationship between two variables chart is that there is a strong direct positive relationship between the variables vaccines distributed and vaccines administered in Washington State in January of 2021. These results can be viewed in many different ways but this indication of a strong positive correlation signifies that as more vaccines are getting distributed, more people are getting vaccinated in Washington. This ideology can be seen not just in Washington, but in the rest of the world in the struggle against COVID-19."),

               p("There were strong patterns in all of our charts and datasets however when diving closely into states rather than the United States of America as a whole, the patterns were tremendously clear and easy to spot.

                 Another notable pattern that occuered in the Vaccinations Across State chart was as the time span increased in the X-axis, going from 01/01/22 to 01/31/22, total number of distrubted vaccinations in Washington also increaseed on the Y-axis. There was a more drastic increase in the begining of the month, as shown through the steep positive points on the graph, and then towards the latter part of January, the values began to become a little stagnant. 
                 The first notable pattern that was noticed in Plot 1 when relating time to total vaccinations throughout all the States in America was that all of the states increased from a very low number of vaccinations such as 0-100 vaccinations and increased to about 30000000 total vaccinations within some of the states at the end of January. This continued to increase as time goes on, allowing the pandemic scientists to be better prepared to solve future situations such as COVID-19
                 The last notable pattern occurred in the Relationship between Two Variables Chart. As the total number of vaccinations distributed in Washington increased on the X-Axis, the number of total vaccinations being administered trended upwards as well throughout the month of January in 2021. In the beginning of the month, there were less than 600000 doses of vaccinations being distributed in Washington and as the number increased to over 1000000 vaccinations doses being distributed, the total vaccinations increased from 200000 to over 700000. I chose to examine these specific time period in Washington because there is a lot of influx of vaccinations and others treatments for the COVID-19 Virus. Some broader implications of this chart include similar patterns emerging around the world as the COVID Virus rages on and people can use this information in order to be better prepared in the future for pandemics and improve public vaccination rates."))
