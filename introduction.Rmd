Looking at our past couple of years, a lot has changed due to COVID-19 Pandemic that has taken the world by storm. Mask mandates and little to no social gatherings caused the world to fall into a depression that is still reaping the world today. Many mistakes were made in the world by not taking action quickly enough to combat this virus and the citizens often were ignorant or did not fully understand the severity of this pandemic situation.
